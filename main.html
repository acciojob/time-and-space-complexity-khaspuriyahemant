	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<P>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by program to run and complete the task. As a progarammer, your goal should to reducethe time complexity of the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient</P>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>is a realted to the amount of memory occuiped by the program.For Example, if a programtakes an array of size input, the sapce complexity of tha program becomes O(n)</p>
